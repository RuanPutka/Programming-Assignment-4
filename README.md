For running the script *run_analysis.R* you need to download the following [data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and unzip it
in the working directory "~/R Projects/R Programming/Programming Assignment 4".

## run_analysis.R
The script *run_analysis.R* does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set named *tiny_data.csv* with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

For more information about the *tiny_data.csv* data set please check the codebook.
